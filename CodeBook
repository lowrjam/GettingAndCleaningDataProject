The outpurt data set is derived from the “Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset v1.0” available 
from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip. 
The data set contains the results of an experiment conducted by:
Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, and Luca Onetoto 

to measure the body movements of 30 test subjects using a Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone. 
The subjects performed 6 different activities:WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING.


The unpacked dataset has the following contents:

'README.txt'

'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

'features.txt': List of all features.

'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.


The names of the final data set’s 88 columns are given below. These were derived from the original data sets which is described more 
fully in ./data/UCI HAR data/features.txt. 

The original test and train data sets contained 10299 combined observations across 30 subjects and 6 activities. 
The final dataset takes the mean of all the mean and standard deviation measurements. 
That is, for 30 subjects across 6 different activities, 180 observations containing the mean values for the mean and 
standard deviation measurements are provided.
